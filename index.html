        I have been a fan of Marvel ever since I started reading comics!  They have thousands of characters - super heroes, villians, cosmic entities, etc.  Some of their heroes have become household names since appearing on the big screen.  I like many of their characters.  My favorite character is a villian - <strong>Dr. Doom</strong>!  Here's a list of my top Marvel characters - if I had to choose.  I could add many more.  Is one of your favorite Marvel characters on my list?  If so, click their name for an awesome illustration!
